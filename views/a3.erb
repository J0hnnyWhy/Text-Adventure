    <h1>What do we have here?</h1>

    <p>After walking for over an hour you catch a glimpse of a wooden object that is virutally covered with moss, sticks, and other annoying nature debris. You walk up to it and tear away the clutter, revealing a wooden door with the words "Come join the party" carved onto it.</p>
    <h4>You've seen way too many movies to know that this can turn out to be really, really good or really, really bad.</h4>
