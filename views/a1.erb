<p>Quickly disregarding the warning, and with moderate strength, you open the box. Inside of the box you see a skeleton key. Laying next to the key is a piece of paper that reads: </p>
<p>"Well, well, well <%= @player_name %> I see you quickly disregarded the warning on the box. (Oh yes, I know your name, and yes, this is soooo super creepy). It's good to know now what kind of person you are-- an awesome person! Only lame-o's pay attention to warnings.
<p>This right here is a key that will open any locks within the carnival, but take note, not all locked places should be opened... *MUAHAHAHAHA!!!*
<p>... I digress.. there are only two ways to enter this specatular, god forsaken place and that's either through the main gate which layeth before you or to head west to the root cellar door ... choose wisely.."</p>
<p></p>
<p>"P.S. This note will self destruct in 10 seconds".</p>

<p>Without missing a beat you shout, "GO GO GADGET LEGS"! And you spring away just in time before the note exploded in a gloirous Michael Bay fashion.</p>

<p>You check your hand to make sure you have the key ... you do.</p>
