<h1>Tunnel of Oooh-La-Uh-Oh!</h1>

<p>What can you say, you've always had a soft spot for romance. You joyously jump in the boat shaped like Herbie the Love Bug. "Groovy", you said you yourself. Just then the doors lock and the ride starts operating on its own. The song "I Wanna Know What Love Is" by Foreigner filled the air and you grabbed the conviently placed box of tissues that's on the dashboard and you start to sob hysterically.</p>

<p>Up ahead you see that the tunnel splits up into two directions. The first tunnel is labled as "PBR" and the second tunnel labled as "Bud Light". You are approaching the fork quickly and have to decide soon using the steering wheel as your udder.
